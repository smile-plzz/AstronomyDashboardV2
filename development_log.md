# Development Log for AstronomyDashboardV2

## 2025-07-14

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Frontend/Backend Structure

*   **Created Root Directory:** `AstronomyDashboardV2` was created.
*   **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Initialized a React project (`frontend`) using Vite (`npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react`).
    *   Installed frontend dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Configured `frontend/vite.config.js` for proxying API requests to the backend.
*   **Backend Setup:**
    *   Created `backend` directory.
    *   Created a Python virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
    *   Installed backend dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`).
    *   Created a basic `backend/main.py` with a root endpoint and a test API endpoint.
    *   Created `backend/.env` to store `NASA_API_KEY`.
*   **Initial Git Setup:**
    *   Initialized a Git repository in the root (`git init`).
    *   Created a root `.gitignore` file covering frontend and backend build artifacts, `node_modules`, `venv`, and `.env` files.
*   **Initial Documentation:**
    *   Created `README.md` in the root, outlining the new architecture, planned features, and setup instructions.

### Next Steps:

*   Implement API endpoints in the FastAPI backend for various NASA APIs.
*   Integrate these backend endpoints into the React frontend.
*   Develop the UI/UX for each feature, focusing on the neumorphic dark theme.
*   Implement interactive elements and data visualization.
*   Refine error handling and loading states.
*   Implement offline support and local storage for favorites.
